By sidd:

1) In navbar.jsx need to add "mytickets" page.
2) In Trains page need to add a "book" button which will lead to a "booking" page 
3) The "booking" page should give us available seats (need to do this in backend) and we choose n number of seats which will be given in the lowest order of availabel seats(for now , lets add more functions later)
4) in the "booking" page create an input for upi id (we will leave it at that for now) and a "submit" button which will take you to "mytickets" page.
